title: Python User Guide

Perspective for Python uses the exact same C++ data engine used by the
[WebAssembly version](https://perspective.finos.org/docs/md/js.html). The
library consists of many of the same abstractions and API as in Javascript,
as well as Python-specific data loading support for [NumPy](https://numpy.org/),
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (and
[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), as in Javascript).

Additionally, `perspective-python` provides a session manager suitable for
integration into server systems such as
[Tornado websockets](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/websocket.html), which
allows fully _virtual_ Perspective tables to be interacted with by multiple
`<perspective-viewer>` in a Web Browser.

As `<perspective-viewer>` will only consume the data necessary to render the
current screen, this runtime mode allows _ludicrous_ _size_ datasets with
instant-load after they've been manifest on the server (at the expense of
network latency on UI interaction).

The included `PerspectiveWidget` allows running such a viewer in
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in either server or
client (via WebAssembly) mode, and the included `PerspectiveTornadoHandler`
makes it simple to extend a Tornado server with virtual Perspective support.

The `perspective` module exports several tools:

- `Table`, the table constructor for Perspective, which implements the `table`
  and `view` API in the same manner as the Javascript library.
- `PerspectiveWidget` the JupyterLab widget for interactive visualization.
- `PerspectiveManager` the session manager for shared server deployment, with a
  reference implementation in [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/).

This user's guide provides an overview of the most common ways to use
Perspective in Python: the `Table` API, the JupyterLab widget, and the Tornado
handler.

For an understanding of Perspective's core concepts, see the
[Conceptual Overview](/docs/md/concepts.html). For API documentation, see the
[Python API](/docs/obj/perspective-python.html).

## `Table`

A `Table` can be created from a dataset or a schema, the specifics of which are
[discussed](#loading-data-with-table) in the Javascript section of the user's
guide. In Python, however, Perspective supports additional data types that are
commonly used when processing data:

- `pandas.DataFrame`
- `numpy.ndarray`
- `numpy.ndarray`
- `bytes` (encoding an Apache Arrow)

A `Table` is created in a similar fashion to its Javascript equivalent:

```python
from datetime import date, datetime
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import perspective

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "int": np.arange(100),
    "float": [i * 1.5 for i in range(100)],
    "bool": [True for i in range(100)],
    "date": [date.today() for i in range(100)],
    "datetime": [datetime.now() for i in range(100)],
    "string": [str(i) for i in range(100)]
})
table = perspective.Table(data, index="float")
```

Likewise, a `View` can be created via the `view()` method:

```python
view = table.view(row_pivots=["float"], filter=[["bool", "==", True]])
column_data = view.to_dict()
row_data = view.to_records()
```

### Pandas & Numpy Support

Perspective supports dictionaries of 1-dimensional `numpy.ndarray`, as well as
structured arrays and record arrays. When passing in dictionaries of NumPy
arrays, make sure that your dataset contains only NumPy arrays, and not a
mixture of arrays and Python lists — this will raise an exception. Numpy
structured/record arrays are parsed according to their field name and dtype.

`Table` can aslo be constructed from `pandas.DataFrame` and `pandas.Series`
objects. Because Perspective is designed for applying its own transformations on
top of a flat dataset, dataframes that are passed in will be flattened and have
its `index` treated as another column (through the
[`reset_index()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.reset_index.html)
method). If the dataframe does not have an index set, an integer-typed column
named `"index"` is created. If you want to preserve the indexing behavior of the
dataframe passed into Perspective, simply create the `Table` with
`index="index"` as a keyword argument. This tells Perspective to once again
treat the index as a primary key:

```python
data.set_index("datetime")
table = perspective.Table(data, index="index")
```

### Schemas & Supported Data Types

Unlike Javascript, where schemas must be created using string representations of
their types, `perspective-python` leverages Python's type system for schema
creation.

A schema can be created with the following types:

- `int` (and `long` in Python 2)
- `float`
- `bool`
- `datetime.date`
- `datetime.datetime`
- `str` (and `unicode` in Python 2)

Once the `Table` has been created with a schema, however, Perspective will cast
the data that it ingests to conform with the schema. This allows for a lot of
flexibility; a column that is typed as a `datetime`, for example, can be updated
with `date` objects, `datetime` objects, `pandas.Timestamp`, `numpy.datetime64`,
and even valid millisecond/seconds from epoch timestamps. Similarly, updating
string columns with integer data will cause a cast to string, updating floats
with ints cause a float cast, and etc.

Type inferrence works similarly—a column that contains `pandas.Timestamp`
objects will have its type inferred as `datetime`, which allows it to be updated
with any of the datetime types that were just mentioned. Thus, Perspective is
aware of the basic type primitives that it supports, but agnostic towards the
actual Python `type` of the data that it receives.

#### Time Zone Handling

When passing in `datetime` objects, Perspective checks the `tzinfo` attribute
to see if a time zone is set. Objects with an unset `tzinfo` attribute are
treated as local time, and do not undergo any time zone conversion. Objects with
the `tzinfo` attribute set will be _converted into UTC_ before being stored in
Perspective, and they will be _serialized as local time_.

`pandas.Timestamp` objects stored in a `pandas.DataFrame` are _always_ treated
as UTC times, and will be converted to local time when serialized to the user.
To treat a `Timestamp` in a `DataFrame` as local time, use `tz_localize` or
`tz_convert` to provide the `Timestamp` with a time zone.

For more details, see this in-depth [explanation](https://github.com/finos/perspective/pull/867)
of Perspective's semantics around time zone handling.

### Callbacks and Events

`perspective.Table` allows for `on_update` and `on_delete` callbacks to be
set—simply call `on_update` or `on_delete` with a reference to a function or a
lambda without any parameters:

```python
def callback():
    print("Updated!")
view.on_update(callback)
view.on_delete(lambda: print("Updated again!"))
```

If the callback is a named reference to a function, it can be removed with
`remove_update` or `remove_delete`. Callbacks defined with a lambda function
cannot be removed, as lambda functions have no identifier.

```python
view.remove_update(callback)
```

## `PerspectiveManager`

`PerspectiveManager` offers an interface for hosting multiple
`perspective.Table` and `perspective.View` instances, extending their
interfaces to operate with the [Javascript library](/docs/md/js.html) over a
websocket connection.

`PerspectiveManager` is required to enable `perspective-python` to
[operate remotely](/docs/md/js.html#remote-perspective-via-perspective-python-and-tornado)
using a websocket API.

### Hosting `Table` and `View` instances

`PerspectiveManager` has the ability to "host" `perspective.Table` and
`perspective.View` instances. Hosted tables/views can have their methods
called from other sources than the user, i.e. by a `perspective-viewer` running
in Javascript over the network, interfacing with `perspective-python` through
the websocket API.

The user has full control of all hosted `Table` and `View` instances, and can
call any API method on hosted instances. This makes it extremely easy to
stream data to a hosted `Table` using `.update()`:

```python
manager = PerspectiveManager()
table = Table(data)
manager.host_table("data_source", table)

for i in range(10):
    # updates continue to propagate automatically
    table.update(new_data)
```

A `PerspectiveManager` instance can host as many `Table`s and `View`s as
necessary, but each `Table` should only be hosted by _one_ `PerspectiveManager`.

To host a `Table` or a `View`, call the corresponding method on an instance
of `PerspectiveManager` with a string name and the instance to be hosted:

```python
manager = PerspectiveManager()
table = Table(data)
view = table.view()
manager.host_table("data_source", table)
manager.host_view("view_1", view)
```

The `name` provided is important, as it enables Perspective in Javascript to look
up a `Table`/`View` and get a handle to it over the network. This enables
several powerful server/client implementations of Perspective, as explained in
the next section.

### Using a hosted `Table` in Javascript

Using Tornado and [`PerspectiveTornadoHandler`](/docs/md/python.html#perspectivetornadohandler),
as well as `Perspective`'s Javascript library, we can create a client/server
architecture that hosts and transforms _massive_ datasets with minimal
client resource usage.

Perspective's design allows a `table()` created in Javascript to _proxy_ its
operations to a `Table` created in Python, which executes the operations in
the Python kernel, and returns the results of the operation to the browser.
All of this is _enabled_ through `PerspectiveManager`, which handles messaging,
processing method calls, serializing outputs for the network, etc.

In Python, use `PerspectiveManager` and `PerspectiveTornadoServer` to create
a websocket server that exposes a `Table`:

_*server.py*_

```python
from perspective import Table, PerspectiveManager, PerspectiveTornadoServer

# Create an instance of PerspectiveManager, and host a Table
MANAGER = PerspectiveManager()
TABLE = Table(large_dataset)

# The Table is exposed at `localhost:8888/websocket` with the name `data_source`
MANAGER.host_table("data_source", TABLE)

app = tornado.web.Application([
    (r"/", MainHandler),
    # create a websocket endpoint that the client Javascript can access
    (r"/websocket", PerspectiveTornadoHandler, {"manager": MANAGER, "check_origin": True})
])

# Start the Tornado server
app.listen(8888)
loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
loop.start()
```

`PerspectiveTornadoHandler`, as outlined in the [docs](/docs/md/python.html#perspectivetornadohandler),
takes a `PerspectiveManager` instance exposes it over a websocket at the URL
specified. This allows a `table()` in Javascript to access the `Table` in
Python and read data from it.

Most importantly, the client code in Javascript does not require Webpack or any
bundler, and can be implemented in a single HTML file:

_*index.html*_

```html
<perspective-viewer id="viewer" editable></perspective-viewer>

<script>
    window.addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', async function() {
        // Create a client that expects a Perspective server
        // to accept connections at the specified URL.
        const websocket = perspective.websocket("ws://localhost:8888/websocket");

        /* `table` is a proxy for the `Table` we created on the server.

        All operations that are possible through the Javascript API are possible
        on the Python API as well, thus calling `view()`, `schema()`, `update()`
        etc. on `const table` will pass those operations to the Python `Table`,
        execute the commands, and return the result back to Javascript.*/
        const table = websocket.open_table('data_source_one');

        // Load this in the `<perspective-viewer>`.
        document.getElementById('viewer').load(table);
    });
</script>
```

### Using a hosted `View` in Javascript

An alternative client/server architecture using `PerspectiveTornadoServer` and
`PerspectiveManager` involves hosting a `View`, and creating a new `table()` in
Javascript on top of the Python `View`.

When the `table()` is created in Javascript, it serializes the Python `View`'s
data into Arrow, transfers it into the Javascript `table()`, and sets up an
`on_update` callback to `update()` the Table whenever the Python `View`'s
`Table` updates.

Implementing the server in Python is extremely similar to the implementation
described in the last section.

Replace `host_table` with `host_view`:

```python
# we have an instance of `PerspectiveManager`
TABLE = Table(data)
VIEW = TABLE.view()
MANAGER.host_view("view_one", VIEW)

# Continue with Tornado setup
```

Changes to the client code are also minimal. Use `open_view` instead of 
`open_table`:

```javascript
// const websocket has been defined already
const view = websocket.open_view("view_one");
const table = perspective.table(view);
// continue with loading the table into `<perspective-viewer>
```

The benefit of this design is that only new updates will be sent to the client,
efficiently serialized in the Apache Arrow format. In exchange for sending the
entire dataset to the client on initialization, it reduces load on the server.

## `PerspectiveWidget`

Building on top of the API provided by `perspective.Table`, the
`PerspectiveWidget` is a JupyterLab plugin that offers the entire functionality
of Perspective within the Jupyter environment. It supports the same API
semantics of `<perspective-viewer>`, along with the additional data types
supported by `perspective.Table`.

Additionally, when created with `client=true` as a keyword argument to
`__init__`, it can be used without accessing the built C++ binary.

Similar to the viewer API, `PerspectiveWidget` takes keyword arguments that
transform the `View` under ownsership:

- `plugin`
- `row_pivots`
- `column_pivots`
- `columns`
- `aggregates`
- `sort`
- `filters`

Arguments that will be passed to the `Table` constructor if a dataset or schema
is passed in:

- [`index`](#index-and-limit)
- [`limit`](#index-and-limit)

As well as keyword arguments specific to `PerspectiveWidget` itself:

- `client`: a boolean that determines whether the Widget will depend on `Table`
  in Python, or if it sends data to the front-end WebAssembly engine for
  processing.

Several Enums are provided to make lookup of specific plugin types, aggregate
types, etc. much easier:

- [`Aggregate`](https://github.com/finos/perspective/blob/master/python/perspective/perspective/core/aggregate.py)
  : aggregate operations
- [`Sort`](https://github.com/finos/perspective/blob/master/python/perspective/perspective/core/sort.py)
  : sort directions
- [`Plugin`](https://github.com/finos/perspective/blob/master/python/perspective/perspective/core/plugin.py)
  : plugins (grid/chart types, etc.)

These can be used as replacements to string values in the API:

```python
from perspective import PerspectiveWidget, Aggregate, Sort, Plugin
w = perspective.PerspectiveWidget(
    data, plugin=Plugin.XBAR, aggregates={"datetime": Aggregate.ANY})
w.sort = [["date", Sort.DESC]]
```

### Client Mode

For certain systems, it may be difficult or infeasible to build the C++ library
for Perspective, which `perspective.Table` depends on. However, we can leverage
`Perspective.js` in the browser to provide the same widget experience to users.
If created with `client=true`, `PerspectiveWidget` will serialize the data to
the best of its ability and pass it off to the browser's Perspective engine to
load.

If `perspective-python` cannot find the built C++ libraries, it automatically
defaults to client mode when initializing the widget.

### Creating a widget

A widget is created through the `PerspectiveWidget` constructor, which takes as
its first, required parameter a `perspective.Table`, a dataset, a schema, or
`None`, which serves as a special value that tells the Widget to defer loading
any data until later. In maintaining consistency with the Javascript API,
Widgets cannot be created with empty dictionaries or lists—`None` should be used
if the intention is to await data for loading later on.

A widget can be constructed from a dataset:

```python
from perspective import PerspectiveWidget, Table
widget = PerspectiveWidget(data, row_pivots=["date"])
```

Or a schema:

```python
widget = PerspectiveWidget({"a": int, "b": str})
```

Or an instance of a `perspective.Table`:

```python
table = Table(data)
widget = PerspectiveWidget(table)
```

Or `None`:

```python
widget = PerspectiveWidget(None)
```

Once the widget has been created, simply call it in order to render the widget's
front-end `<perspective-viewer>`:

```python
widget
```

### `load()`

Calling `load()` on the widget provides it with a dataset. If the widget already
has a dataset, and the new data has different columns to the old one, then the
widget state (pivots, sort, etc.) is cleared to prevent applying settings on
columns that don't exist.

Like `__init__`, load accepts a `perspective.Table`, a dataset, or a schema. If
running in client mode, `load` defers to the browser's Perspective engine. This
means that loading Python-only datasets, especially ones that cannot be
serialized into JSON, may cause some issues.

```python
widget = PerspectiveWidget(None)
widget.load(data)
```

### `update()`

Call `update()` on the widget to update it with new data. When called in client
mode, this method serializes the data and passes it off to the Perspective
engine running in the browser.

```python
widget.update(data)
```

### `clear()` and `replace()`

Calling `clear()` on the widget will remove all data from the underlying
`Table`, but preserve all user-applied settings to the widget.

```python
widget.clear()
widget.table.size() # True
```

Calling `replace(data)` on the widget with new data will remove the table's old
data, and replace it with the new dataset, while preserving all widget state.

```python
widget.replace(df2)
```

Both methods do not change the schema of the Table, so new data must conform to
the schema.

### `reset()`

Call `reset()` on the widget to return it to an unpivoted, unmodified state. The
`Table` that contains the widget's data is not affected.

```python
widget = PerspectiveWidget(data, row_pivots=["date"], plugin=Plugin.XBAR)
widget.reset()
widget.plugin  # "hypergrid"
```

## `PerspectiveTornadoHandler`

Perspective ships with a pre-built Tornado handler that makes integration with
`tornado.websockets` extremely easy. This allows you to run an instance of
`Perspective` on a server using Python, open a websocket to a `Table`, and
access the `Table` in Javascript and through `<perspective-viewer>`.

All instructions sent to the `Table` are processed in Python, which executes the
commands, and returns its output through the websocket back to Javascript.

### Python setup

To use the handler, we need to first have an instance of a `Table` and a
`PerspectiveManager`—the manager acts as the interface between the Javascript
and the Python layers, implementing a JSON API that allows the two Perspective
runtimes to communicate.

```python
MANAGER = PerspectiveManager()
```

Once the manager has been created, create a `Table` instance and call
`host_table` on the manager with a name, passing through a reference to the
`Table` you just created. `host_table()` registers the Table with the manager
and allows the manager to send instructions to the Table.

The name that you host the table under is important—it acts as a unique accessor
on the Javascript side, which will look for a Table hosted at the websocket with
the name you specify.

```python
TABLE = Table(data)
MANAGER.host_table("data_source_one", TABLE)
```

After the manager and table setup is complete, create a websocket endpoint and
provide it a reference to PerspectiveTornadoHandler. You must provide the
configuration object in the route tuple, and it must contain `manager`, which is
a reference to the `PerspectiveManager` you just created.

```python
app = tornado.web.Application([
    (r"/", MainHandler),
    # create a websocket endpoint that the client Javascript can access
    (r"/websocket", PerspectiveTornadoHandler, {"manager": MANAGER, "check_origin": True})
])
```

Optionally, the configuration object can also include `check_origin`, a boolean
that determines whether the websocket accepts requests from origins other than
where the server is hosted. See
[Tornado docs](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/websocket.html#tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler.check_origin)
for more details.

### Javascript setup

Once the server is up and running, you can access the Table you just hosted
using `perspective.websocket` and `open_table()`. First create a client that
expects a Perspective server to accept connections at the specified URL:

```javascript
const websocket = perspective.websocket("ws://localhost:8888/websocket");
```

Next open the `Table` we created on the server by name:

```javascript
const table = websocket.open_table("data_source_one");
```

`table` is a proxy for the `Table` we created on the server. All operations that
are possible through the Javascript API are possible on the Python API as well,
thus calling `view()`, `schema()`, `update()` etc on `const table` will pass
those operations to the Python `Table`, execute the commands, and return the
result back to Javascript. Similarly, providing this `table` to a
`<perspective-viewer>` instance will allow virtual rendering:

```javascript
viewer.load(table);
viewer.toggleConfig();
```

`perspective.websocket` expects a Websocket URL where it will send instructions.
When `open_table` is called, the name to a hosted Table is passed through, and a
request is sent through the socket to fetch the Table. No actual Table instance
is passed inbetween the runtimes; all instructions are proxied through
websockets.

This provides for great flexibility — while `Perspective.js` is full of
features, browser WebAssembly runtimes currently have some performance
restrictions on memory and CPU feature utilization, and the architecture in
general suffers when the dataset itself is too large to download to the client
in full.

The Python runtime does not suffer from memory limitations, utilizes
[TBB](https://github.com/intel/tbb) for threading and parallel processing, and
generates architecture optimized code, which currently makes it more suitable as
a server-side runtime than `node.js`.
