title: Developer Guide
---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Perspective! This guide will
teach you everything you need to know to get started hacking on the Perspective
codebase.

If you're coming to this project as principally a Javascript developer, please
be aware that Perspective is quite a bit more complex than a typical NPM package
due to the mixed-language nature of the project; we've done quite a bit to make
sure the newcomer experience is as straightforward as possible, but some things
might not work the way you're used to!

Perspective is organized as a
[monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md),
and uses [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to manage dependencies. The
`@finos/perspective` modules has an additional, unmanaged dependency—the
[Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) compiler, which is used to
compile the core C++ engine to WebAssembly, and must be installed independently.

This guide provides instructions for both the Javascript and Python libraries.
To switch your development toolchain between the two, use `yarn setup`. Once the
setup script has been run, common commands like `yarn build` and `yarn test`
automatically call the correct build and test tools.

## Building

To run a build, use

```bash
yarn build
```

If this is the first time you've built Perspective, you'll be asked to generate
a `.perspectiverc` via a short survey. This can be later re-configured via

```bash
yarn setup
```

If everything is successful, you should be able to run any of the `examples/`
packages, e.g. `examples/simple` like so:

```bash
yarn start simple
```

#### Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) images with pre-built development
environments are provided for the Javascript and Python libraries.

To build Perspective using Docker, select the option in `yarn setup`.

### System Dependencies

Perspective requires some system dependencies to be installed before it can be
built from source:

- Boost (version 1.67)
- CMake (version 3.15.4 or higher)
- TBB
- [Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_building.html)

### `Perspective.js`

To build the Javascript library, which includes WebAssembly compilation,
[Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) and its prerequisites are
required. A Docker image is provided with the correct environment and
prerequisites.

#### Building via EMSDK

To build using local Emscripten,
[install](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) the
Emscripten SDK, then activate and export the latest `emsdk` environment via
[`emsdk_env.sh`](https://github.com/juj/emsdk):

```bash
source emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
```

We currently use Emscripten version `1.38.47` — deviating from this specific
version of Emscripten can introduce various errors that are extremely difficult
to debug.

To install this specific version of Emscripten:

```bash
./emsdk install 1.38.47
```

### `perspective-python`

To build the Python library, navigate to the python source folder
(`python/perspective`) and install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Make sure that TBB is installed, as it is a system dependency:

```bash
brew install TBB
```

`perspective-python` supports Python 3.7 and upwards, as well as Python 2.7.17.
To build the Python 2 version of the library, use the `--python2` flag:

```bash
yarn build --python2
```

## System-Specific Instructions

### MacOS/OSX specific instructions

Installing and activating the latest
[Emscripten SDK](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten):

```bash
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
```

You'll also need the system dependencies noted earlier - installing them through
Homebrew is the easiest way, especially as flatbuffers can be installed through
`brew` without building from source:

```bash
brew install boost@1.67
brew install tbb
brew install cmake
brew install flatbuffers
```

If building the Python 2 version of the library, make sure your version of
Python 2 is the latest version (`2.7.17`) supplied by Homebrew, and not the
earlier version that ships with MacOS. To install Python 2 using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python2
```

### Windows 10 specific instructions

You need to use bash in order to build Perspective packages. To successfully
build on Windows 10, enable
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
(WSL) and install the linux distribution of your choice.

Create symbolic links to easily access Windows directories and projects modified
via Windows. This way you can modify any of the Perspective files using your
favorite editors on Windows and build via Linux.

Follow the Linux specific instructions to install Emscripten and all
prerequisite tools.

### Ubuntu/Debian

When installing Emscripten, make sure to follow
[Linux specific instructions](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#linux).

On Ubuntu, cmake will mistakenly resolve the system headers in `/usr/include`
rather than the emscripten supplied versions. You can resolve this by moving
`boost` and `flatbuffers` dependencies to somewhere other than `/usr/include` -
into perspective's own `src` dir, for example (as per
[here](http://vclf.blogspot.com/2014/08/emscripten-linking-to-boost-libraries.html)).

```bash
apt-get install libboost-all-dev
cp -r /usr/include/boost ./packages/perspective/src/include/

cd ./packages/perspective/src/include/
git clone https://github.com/google/flatbuffers.git
cd flatbuffers
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
make
ln -s /usr/local/flatbuffers/flatc /usr/local/bin/flatc
chmod +x /usr/local/flatbuffers/flatc
```

## Testing

You can run the test suite simply with the standard NPM command, which will both
build the test suite for every package and run them.

```bash
yarn test
```

A Test name regex can be passed to `jest` via the same `-t` flag:

```bash
yarn test -t 'button test (A|B)'
```

### Javascript

The Javascript test suite is composed of two sections: a Node.js test which
asserts behavior of the `@finos/perspective` library, and a suite of
[Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) tests which
assert the behavior of the rest of the UI facing packages. For the latter,
you'll need Docker installed, as these tests use a Puppeteer and Chrome build
installed in a Docker container.

The Puppeteer/UI tests are a form of
[characterization tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test)
which use screenshots to compare current and previous behavior of
`<perspective-viewer>` and its plugins. The results of the each comparison are
stored in each package's `test/results/results.json` file, and the screenshots
themselves are stroed in the package's `screenshots/` directory, though only the
former should be checked in to GIT. When a test in these suites fails, a
`file.failed.png` and `file.diff.png` are also generated, showing the divergent
screenshot and a contrast diff respectively, so you can verify that the changed
behavior either does or does not reflect your patch. If you're confident that
the screenshots reflect your change, you can update the new hashes manually in
the `test/results/results.json` file, or update all hashes with the `--wrte`
flag:

```bash
yarn test --write
```

For quick local iteration and debugging failing tests, the puppeteer tests can
use a local copy of Puppeteer, rather than relying on the supplied Docker image.
These will run much quicker, and can be optionally run without `--headless` mode
for debugging test failures quickly. However, due to rendering inconsistencies
between platforms, the resulting test hashes will not match the ones saved in
`results.json`, so you will need to re-run the suite with the `--write` flag to
generate a `results.local.json` file specific to your OS.

To toggle between Local and Docker Puppeteer, run

```bash
yarn toggle_puppeteer
```

This will install a local copy of puppeteer via `yarn` the first time it is run,
if a local puppeteer is not found.

### Python

The Python test suite is built on Pytest, and it asserts the correct behavior of
the Python library.

If you have built the library with the `--python2` flag, make sure to run the
test suite using the `--python2` flag as well. Running a version of
perspective-python built against Python 2 in Python 3 (and vice versa) is not
supported.

Verbosity in the tests can be enabled with the `--verbose` flag.

#### Timezones in Python Tests

Python tests are configured to use the `UTC` timezone. If running tests locally,
you might find that datetime-related tests fail to assert the correct values. To
correct this, run tests with the `TZ=UTC`, i.e.

```bash
TZ=UTC yarn test --verbose
```

## Benchmarking

You can generate benchmarks specific to your machine's OS and CPU architecture
with Perspective's benchmark suite, which will generate a `report.html` file in
the `build/` directory of every package which supports benchmarks, as well as a
`results.json` file in the `bench/results/`, which can be checked in to GIT with
your changes to preserve them for future comparison.

```javascript
yarn bench
```

Use the `--limit <NUMBER>` flag to control the number of Perspective versions
that the benchmark suite will run, where `<NUMBER>` is an integer greater
than 0. If `<NUMBER>` cannot be parsed, is 0, or is greater than the number of
versions, the benchmark suite will run all previous versions of Perspective.

The benchmarks report and `results.json` show a historgram of current
performance, as well as that of the previous `results.json`. Running this should
probably be standard practice after making a large change which may affect
performance, but please create a baseline `results.json` entry for your test
machine on a commit before your changes first, such that the effects of your PR
can be properly compared.
