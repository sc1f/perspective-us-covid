Perspective 0.3.0 is out now, thanks to the tireless effots of the Perspective
[Contributors](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/perspective/graphs/contributors)!
With this release comes the standard new-release Features, APIs, and Fixes;
more importantly, it also features - a new home!

`@jpmorganchase/perspective` is now `@finos/perspective` as Perspective moves to the
[Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://www.finos.org/). The project [Github](https://github.com/finos/perspective/),
[Gitter]() and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/finos/perspective/) have moved as well.

... of course, the Features, Fixes and APIs are really important too. So 
much so that they have their own section.

### D3FC Plugin

<img src="../../../../img/2019-06-10-v0.3.0-release/d3fc.png"></img>

An entirely new charting plugin based on [D3FC](https://d3fc.io/), with new
chart types as well as all your old favorites.  `@finos/perspective-viewer-d3fc` is
completely OSS, and fully replaces `@finos/perspective-viewer-highcharts`.

Featuring new charts like Candlestick, as well as new zoom interactions, resizable
and repositionable legends, multiple Y-axes, and more!

### Data

<img src="../../../../img/2019-06-10-v0.3.0-release/performance2.png"></img>

Perspective now supports full streaming via Apache Arrow.  Load your data into
a `perspective` instance on the server via node.js, and stream state & updates via
[Apache Arrow]() to a `perspective` instance in the browser, without ever
converting touching JSON.

CPU time and memory usage improvements to reading, 
querying and writing performance have been made, as well
as a new scheduler with substantially better overall data throughput.

With the new [`perspective-cli`]() command-line tool, encode an Arrow from a CSV
or even host a simple Perspective HTTP/WebSocket server.

### UX

<img src="../../../../img/2019-06-10-v0.3.0-release/linked.png"></img>

`<perspective-viewer>` now emits interaction events for all plugins types, which
can be hooked wired together with other `<perspective-viewer>`s to create
complex cross-filtered dashboards.

<br style="clear:both;" />

New `copy`, `download`, `reset` actions available via an options toolbar, and 
flatten quickly with`shift-click`.  Render warnings prevent huge visualizations 
from unintentionally overwhelming the browser.  Smart category filters, column 
sorting, and more!
