Perspective v0.4.0 is now available wherever open-source streaming columnar
analytics engines are downloaded!  In addition to being FINOS' Most 
Contributed-To Project in 2020, Perspective achieves yet another first with

Perspective is now a native Python library!  

With `perspective-python`, a python-created `Table()` can be used
to accumulate & incrementally stream [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) deltas to a Perspective 
WebAssembly instance running in a client browser for ultra-high message
bandwidth over a network;  or, expose Perspective `Table()` via a websocket virtually to any
`<perspective-viewer>` WebComponent client without your data ever leaving the server.

Perspective Python implements a nearly identical
[API](https://perspective.finos.org/docs/obj/perspective-python.html)
to Perspective WebAssembly, and is almost entirely the same C++ engine. It
additionally provides:
* High performance loaders and converters for Apache Arrow (as `bytes`), `numpy`
  and `pandas` types.
* A `PerspectiveManager` client/server model for connecting
  `<perspective-viewer>` or other `perspective-python` clients virtually.
* A powerful `PerspectiveWidget` client for [Jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which can run in
  both WebAssembly and virtual Python modes.
* An example server handler for [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)
* 2.7-3.9+ compatible, for Linux, OSX and Windows**

Check out the new [User's
Guide](https://perspective.finos.org/docs/md/python.html) and
[API docs](https://perspective.finos.org/docs/obj/perspective-python.html) to
get started.
