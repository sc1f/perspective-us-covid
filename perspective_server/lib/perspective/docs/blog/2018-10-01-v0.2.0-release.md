After nine months of tireless development and over 700 commits from 18 
exceptionally talented [contributors](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/perspective/graphs/contributors),
we are pleased to announce the v0.2.0 release of Perspective!  With this release
comes a cavalcade of exciting features, performance optimizations, bug fixes, 
and <strike>easter eggs</strike> usability improvements.

Get started quickly with our [new and improved documentation](https://jpmorganchase.github.io/perspective/docs/installation.html),
or try out some [live examples on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/user/texodus/fiddles/)!

## User Experience

<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/jupyter.png"></img>

Perspective now features a first class & completely symmetric 
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) widget, via the
[perspective-python](https://github.com/timkpaine/perspective-python)
package, available via pip.


<br style="clear:both;" />
<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/theme.png"></img>

The new [Material](https://material.io/design/) inspired design is clear, functional and 
trendy.  Comes in both [Day](https://unpkg.com/@jpmorganchase/perspective-examples@0.2.0/build/theme-material.html), 
and a [Night](https://unpkg.com/@jpmorganchase/perspective-examples@0.2.0/build/theme-material-dark.html) 
flavor for after market hours (be sure to [wear sunglasses!](../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/sunglasses.png)).

<br style="clear:both;" />
<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/interface.png"></img>

Perspective's User Interface has seen readability, usability and functionality 
changes, including better control labels, column remove buttons, sort direction
indicators, filter operator `select`, auto-complete of filter terms based on data,
smart parsing filter dates;  just to name a few!

<br style="clear:both;" />
<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/computed.png"></img>

Computed Columns allow you to create time-bucketed series, categorize and group
values by function, combine columns through simple mathematical operations, 
duplicate columns for calculating multiple aggregates, and
much, much more!

<br style="clear:both;" />
<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/remote.png"></img>

Run Perspective without your data ever leaving the server!  With Perspective
running in Remote mode, the entire User Experience can be virtualized to the
server, rather than downloading your data to the client, substantially improving
performance for enormous datasets.  All in just a few lines of code!

### Highcharts Plugin

<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/hierarchial.png"></img>

Hierarchial chart types: `heatmap`, `treemap` and `sunburst`.  See the 
structure of your pivotted data more clearly than ever before!

<br style="clear:both;" />
<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/subchart.png"></img>

Sub-charts are rendered for `column-pivot` categories on `treemap` and
`sunburst` chart types, allowing you to separately chart any data category.

<br style="clear:both;" />
<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/boost.png"></img>

Substantial performance improvements for most chart types, which will
now also take advantage of [Highcharts boost mode]() where available, allow
visualization of substantially larger datasets.

<br style="clear:both;" />
<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/axis.png"></img>

Category (string) and Date/time Axis types are available on all charts, where
they will be applied automatically based on your data's <i>schema</i>.

<br style="clear:both;" />

### Hypergrid Plugin

In addition to a new <i>lazy mode</i> which only loads data visible in the
viewport, substantially improving render performance for huge datasets,
Perspective's Hypergrid plugin received one of the most requested features
ever:

<img src="../../../../img/2018-10-01-v0.2.0-release/expandcollapse.png"></img>

By popular demand, collapse rows alone or in groups, and even 
[across real-time updates](https://unpkg.com/@jpmorganchase/perspective-examples@0.2.0/build/streaming.html).

<br style="clear:both;" />

* (major) Bug fixes
    * Better input type inference, better automated output formatting (dates).
    * Better support for Apache Arrow, for the ultimate in load-time performance.
    * More consistent use of `promise` for asynchronous APIs.

* New APIs
    * Clipboard, config save/restore, export, reset, row delete `<perspective-viewer>` APIs.
    * `to_columns()`, `to_csv()` output methods.
    * Partial updates and <i>unset</i> cell semantics.
    * `weighted_mean` aggregate, 'in' filter operator.
    * `WorkerHost()` for powering `<perspective-viewer>` via a remote Node.js process.
    * Lifecycle events.

* Structural improvements
    * Deprecation of the `perspective-common` and `perspective-examples` modules.
    * A new top-level `examples/` directory containing full example projects.
    * Flattened Web Assembly asset strucutre for a smaller module, simpler 
      project integration and easier hosting.
